# Smith-Waterman
Implementation of Smith Waterman algorithm, used to perform local sequence alignment

# Running the script
This script takes two sequences in .fasta format. It uses the BLOSUM62-matrix to determine match-scores, you need to have BLOSUM64.txt in the same directory wich you run the script from. 

    $ python3 Smith-Waterman.py <seq1.fasta> <seq2.fasta>
